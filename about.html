                    <p>As you might've guessed by the title of this page, my name is Jon Burke. Technically, it's 'Jonathan', but I'm usually only called that when I'm in trouble. Since this whole site is dedicated to having you get to know me a bit better, I'm going to keep this section fairly brief.</p>
                    <p>I recently started the journey of my 5th decade on this planet (that's 40's for those who need help with the math). I've been married to my wife for almost 10 years, I have three cats, and I live "deep in the New Jersey Woods" as my niece describes it. My pronouns are he/him.</p>
                    <p>I very much like video games, movies, music, TV, board games, and pretty much anything that will keep me entertained.</p>
                    <p>I'm a typical Elder Millenial. Making this website brought me back to Angelfire and MySpace - it's taken quite a bit of willpower not to make this page lime green text on black, with a huge rotating "Under Construction" banner at the top and bottom.</p>
                    <p>My intention for this site is to offer its visitors a glimpse into my world, if they'd like to see it. If you'd like to see some things I've created, you're more than welcome to check out the <strong>Portfolio</strong> page. My online <strong>resumé</strong> lives here as well, should you be interested in making me a lucrative job offer. You can reach out to me about that offer - or about anything else you'd like - by heading over to the <strong>Contact</strong> page. I've been told that I'm a good listener.</p>
